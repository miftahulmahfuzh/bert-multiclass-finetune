You are given a news article with the following structure:

<<NEWS>>

Your task is to extract relevant information and structure it in HTML format based on the following criteria:

1. **Stock Tag (`<stock>`):**
   - If the article mentions a publicly traded company along with its stock code, include it in this tag.
   - Example: `<stock>AAAA, BBBB, CCCC</stock>`
   - If no stock is mentioned, do not include this tag.

2. **Industry Tag (`<industry>`):**
   - Identify the industry relevant to the article (e.g., "Industri Transportasi," "Industri Keuangan").
   - Example: `<industry>Industri Transportasi</industry>`
   - If no industry is relevant, do not include this tag.

3. **Market Tag (`<market>`):**
   - If the article pertains to a specific market (e.g., national stock market, economy trends in a country), include the market's nationality.
   - Default: `"Indonesian Market"` unless otherwise specified.
   - Example: `<market>Indonesian Market</market>`
   - If no market is relevant, do not include this tag.

### **Output Format Example:**
For an article about PT Adi Sarana Armada Tbk (ASSA), which operates in logistics and transportation in Indonesia, the output should look like this:

<stock>ASSA</stock>
