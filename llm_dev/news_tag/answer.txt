Alright, I'm looking at the user's query where they want me to structure a news article into specific HTML tags. The example given is about PT Adi Sarana Armada Tbk (ASSA). 

First, I need to identify if there are any stock mentions. The article clearly states "PT Adi Sarana Armada Tbk (ASSA)" which indicates the stock code ASSA should be included in the <stock> tag.

Next, determining the industry. Since the company is involved in logistics and transportation, the appropriate industry tag would be "Industri Transportasi."

Lastly, for the market, since the article mentions Jakarta and discusses an Indonesian company, it's safe to default to "Indonesian Market" as per the guidelines.

I should make sure each tag is correctly formatted without any extra text or explanations. Just the relevant information within the appropriate tags.

<stock>ASSA</stock>
<industry>Industri Transportasi</industry>
<market>Indonesian Market</market>
