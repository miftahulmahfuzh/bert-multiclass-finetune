Alright, let's tackle this problem. I need to extract information from a given news article structure and format it using HTML tags based on specific criteria. The article provided is: "TBLA - Taboola Signs memasuki kesepakatan eksklusif baru selama lima tahun dengan Grey Television."

First, looking at the **Stock Tag** criteria. I need to check if there's any mention of a publicly traded company with its stock code in the article. Scanning through the text, it mentions "TBLA" but doesn't specify that it's a stock ticker or provide any stock codes like ASSA mentioned in the example. So, since there's no stock information provided, I won't include the `<stock>` tag.

Next up is the **Industry Tag**. The article talks about Taboola and Grey Television entering into an exclusive agreement. Both are companies involved in digital media and technology sectors. However, the primary focus here isn't on an industry-specific sector like transport or finance but rather on the tech domain they're entering. Since there's no clear indication of a specific industry category beyond general business terms, I won't include the `<industry>` tag.

Lastly, for the **Market Tag**, the article doesn't specify any particular market it pertains to, such as national stock markets in Indonesia or global markets like the US or UK. Without this information, I also won't include the `<market>` tag.

Putting it all together, none of the tags apply here because there's no mention of a stock ticker, industry specific to the text, or relevant market mentioned.
