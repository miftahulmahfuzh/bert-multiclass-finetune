    Sample Stock Expert Answer:
    Over the last 21 days (February 3 to February 21, 2025), ADHI stock price decreased from 216 to 198 IDR, a decline of about 8.33%.
    The evidence leans toward the stock being undervalued, with a trailing P/E ratio of 6.41 and forward P/E of 5.29, lower than peers like PT Wijaya Karya (forward P/E 11.67).
    Research suggests potential buying opportunity due to low price/sales (0.09) and price/book (0.19) ratios, despite high debt/equity (100.27%).
    It is recommended to buy, but with caution due to recent price decline and high debt, acknowledging the complexity of investment decisions.
